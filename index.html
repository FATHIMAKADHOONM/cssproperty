    <h1>ANIMATION</h1> 
    
         <body>
         <p>Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional
          animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and 
          exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer
          animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of
          traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings.
          Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like
          paper cutouts, puppets, hello what re ahjhj or clay figures.Commonly, the effect of the animation is achieved by a rapid
          succession of sequential images that the rapid display of sequential images include
          the ph√©nakisticope, zoetrope, flip book, praxinoscope, and film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer
          animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of
          traditional animation) can be used for stylistic . For display on the
          computer, techniques like animated GIF and Flash animation were developed. <br><br>
          Hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation, people from all over the world enjoyed
          shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry, automata, shadow
          play, and the magic lantern. The multi-media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in West-European
          theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the 19th century, featured lifelike 
          projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion.<br>
